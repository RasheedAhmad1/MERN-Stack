# MERN Stack Web Development 

## What is MERN Stack?
MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier
and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. 
MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely:
MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS.

The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a
3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database)
entirely using JavaScript and JSON

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database in which data is stored
in documents that consist of key-value pairs, sharing
a lot of resemblance to JSON.

### Express JS
Express is a flexible and clean Node.js web application
framework that provides a robust set of features to
develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the
rapid development of Node based web applications.

### React JS
React is an open-source JavaScript library that is
used for building user interfaces specifically for
single-page applications. It’s used for handling the
view layer for web and mobile apps.

### Node JS
NodeJS is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment, it’s built on Chrome’s V8 engine to run
JavaScript code outside the browser, for easily
building fast and scalable applications.

## All algorithms implemented in javascript (for education)
These implementations are for learning purposes only. Therefore they may be less efficient than the implementations in the javascript standard library.
